        <h2>Appearance and behaviour</h2>
        <p>
          Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs
          often chase cats, and most dogs will fetch a ball or stick. Dogs can
          smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well in color
          because they are color blind. Due to the anatomy of the eye, dogs can
          see better in dim light than humans. They also have a wider field of
          vision. Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called packs. Packs of
          dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other
          dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the alpha
          male. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs
          often view their owner as the alpha male <sup>[9]</sup>

        <h3>Lifespan</h3>
        <p>
          Different dog breeds have different lifespans. In general, smaller
          dogs live longer than bigger ones.[10] The size and the breed of the
          dog change how long the dog lives, on average. Breeds such as the
          Dachshund usually live for fifteen years, Chihuahuas can reach age
          twenty. The Great Dane, on the other hand has an average lifespan of
          six to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for ten years.
